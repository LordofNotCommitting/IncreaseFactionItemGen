**Need to restart the game after MCM config setup for mode change to take effect**

Faction item production is separate from any other normal processing, and is flat rate across all stations and systems. regardless of production chain or population or etc.
This is how it functions: For Every **[Period]** weeks, each station have **[percentage]**% of producing **[Count]**# of item from faction item pool.

In 0.9.5 (stable) it is:
Every **2** Weeks
Each Station have **5**% chance of producing
**3** faction items.

In 0.9.8 (latest beta as of right now) it is:
Every **2** Weeks
Each Station have **25**% chance of producing
**5** faction items.

As you may have noticed, station didn't produce anything in stable and beta increased latest faction item production rate by approx +733% to compensate. But it can always be nerfed, or not enough. For either case this mod is for you.
All value involved in above calculation can be adjusted via MCM menu.
